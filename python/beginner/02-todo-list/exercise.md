# Project 2: Todo List Manager

## Objective
Create a command-line todo list application that allows users to manage tasks.

## Skills You'll Learn
- Lists and list operations
- File I/O (reading/writing to files)
- String manipulation
- Loops (for, while)
- Data persistence

## Requirements
1. Add new tasks to the todo list
2. View all tasks
3. Mark tasks as completed
4. Delete tasks
5. Save tasks to a file so they persist between runs

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create functions for each operation (add_task, view_tasks, complete_task, delete_task)
2. Use a list to store tasks
3. Implement a menu system
4. Add file operations to save/load tasks
5. Handle edge cases (empty list, invalid task numbers)

## Bonus Challenges
- Add due dates to tasks
- Implement task priorities (high, medium, low)
- Add categories or tags to tasks
- Create a search function

## Expected Output Example
```
=== Todo List Manager ===
1. Add task
2. View tasks
3. Complete task
4. Delete task
5. Quit

Choose option: 2

Your tasks:
1. [ ] Buy groceries
