# Project 1: Calculator

## Objective
Build a command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

## Skills You'll Learn
- Input/output operations
- Basic arithmetic
- Function definitions
- Control flow (if/elif/else)
- Error handling with try/except

## Requirements
1. Create a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide
2. Ask the user for two numbers and an operation
3. Display the result
4. Handle division by zero
5. Allow the user to perform multiple calculations

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Start by creating a function for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
2. Create a main function that displays a menu
3. Get user input for numbers and operation
4. Call the appropriate function and display the result
5. Add error handling for invalid inputs

## Bonus Challenges
- Add more operations (power, square root, modulo)
- Keep a history of calculations
- Add input validation to ensure numbers are entered correctly

## Expected Output Example
```
Welcome to Calculator!
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Quit

Choose operation (1-5): 1
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Result: 10 + 5 = 15

Continue? (y/n): y
```

## Files to Create
- `calculator.py` - Your main calculator program
- `test_calculator.py` - Simple tests for your functions (optional)

## Time Estimate
2-4 hours
